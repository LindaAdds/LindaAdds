  Hello! I am Linda Adams, otherwise known as THE "CrossStitchNerd" and I create Original Counted Cross Stitch Patterns from pictures that I find on the internet and put them up for sale in my shop. Also, I have the capability to make an original pattern from just about any photo. I only need answers to a few questions.
  Iâ€™m interested in musicians as I love music but don't play an instrument and can't carry a tune in a bucket. So, I express my love by creating patterns of musicians and their bands and occasionally stitch them up with my little pieces of embroidery floss! 
- I'm currently learning embroidery and am planning on implementing embroidery stitches in addition to cross stitch! 
  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the creation of interesting subject matter for use in my creation of my patterns, either photographers, digital creators or those who are gifted in the art of artificial intelligent pictures.
